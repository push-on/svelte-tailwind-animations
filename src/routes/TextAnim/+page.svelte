        There was a road along with that open place. When the tiger saw any man
        passing by he said to him, â€œBrother, here is a good bangle. I wish to
        give it to you. Don't fear. lam old and infirm now. I now pray to God
        five times a day and doing it will be useful to you. Don't fear, come to
        me and take other religious acts. This bangle is useless to me. It will
        be useful to you. Don't fear, come to me and take this.

        A man dealt in salt. He had an ass to carry loads of salt from a distant
        town. There was a stream on the way. The ass had to cross that river
        every day. One day the ass fell into the river. Some of the salt melted
        in the water. The load became lighter.
